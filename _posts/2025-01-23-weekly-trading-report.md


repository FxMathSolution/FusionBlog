# Weekly Trading Report - January 23, 2025

Welcome to the **Weekly Trading Report** for FxTurn Trade Fusion AI. This report provides an overview of our trading performance, key insights, and strategies implemented during the week.

---

## Performance Overview

This week, we analyzed the performance of **100 trading baskets** over the first **6 hours** after opening. Here are the key findings:

- **Average Maximum Profit**: **113 pips**
- **Average Maximum Loss**: **-62 pips**
- **Highest Profit (Single Basket)**: **885 pips**
- **Lowest Profit (Single Basket)**: **-249 pips**

These results indicate that the **majority of baskets are profitable**, with the **average profit being approximately twice the size of the average drawdown**. This demonstrates a **favorable risk-reward profile** for our strategy.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. **Early Performance as a Predictor**
We conducted an additional test over a **3-hour duration** to evaluate the significance of early performance. The results confirmed that:

- Baskets that **immediately move into profit** are likely to remain profitable.
- Baskets that show a **significant drawdown (DD)** early on are more likely to end up as losers.

This highlights the importance of **monitoring initial performance** as a reliable indicator of overall basket outcomes.

### 2. **Continuous Patterns in Basket Performance**
Our analysis revealed that **losing or profitable baskets tend to follow continuous patterns**. For example, if the current basket is a loser, there’s a higher likelihood that the next one will also be a loser. This observation underscores the need for a **dynamic strategy** to manage such scenarios.

---

## Strategy Implementation

To address the challenge of continuous losing patterns, we implemented the following strategy:

1. **Open a Basket at 8:00 AM**:  
   A basket is opened at **8:00 AM**, initiating **10 trades**.

2. **Monitor Performance**:  
   If the basket goes into **drawdown (DD)**, we wait for **6-12 hours** to see if it recovers and moves into profit.

3. **Inject New Trades at 8:00 PM**:  
   If, by **8:00 PM**, the basket is still in drawdown and shows no signs of recovery, we **inject additional trades** for the remaining currency pairs by pressing the **"Open All Trades"** button.

4. **Leverage Changing Market Dynamics**:  
   This approach capitalizes on the fact that **market conditions at 8:00 PM** are likely different from those at **8:00 AM**. By adding new trades at this stage, we increase the chances of reducing the overall drawdown and managing the basket more effectively.

5. **Achieve Target Profit or Breakeven**:  
   The new trades help us either **reach our target profit** or at least **close the basket at breakeven (zero profit)**.

## Results and Outcomes

This strategy has proven effective in **mitigating losses** and improving the overall performance of our baskets. By adapting to real-time market conditions, we ensure that our trading approach remains **flexible and responsive**.

---

## Recommendations for Next Week

1. **Focus on Early Performance**:  
   Continue monitoring the **initial performance** of baskets to identify potential winners or losers early on.

2. **Refine Trade Injection Timing**:  
   Experiment with different timeframes for injecting new trades to optimize results.

3. **Enhance Risk Management**:  
   Further refine stop-loss and take-profit levels to maximize the risk-reward ratio.
