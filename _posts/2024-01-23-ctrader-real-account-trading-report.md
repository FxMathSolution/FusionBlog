The analysis is based on a 2-3 day trading period, and I will break down the performance of a $300 account, as well as extrapolate the results for $100 and $200 accounts.

## Observations from Real Account Testing:

1. **Small Accounts Can Perform Well**: Even with a $300 account, a 5.12% return in 2-3 days is achievable. Smaller accounts ($100 and $200) showed even higher percentage returns (15% and 7.5%, respectively), though the absolute profit remains the same.

2. **Risk Management is Key**: The maximum drawdown was $10, which is 3.33% of the $300 account. This is a manageable risk level, but it’s important to keep drawdowns under control, especially for smaller accounts.

3. **Pair Selection Matters**: Some pairs, like **NZDJPY** and **CHFJPY**, were highly profitable, while others, like **GBPJPY** and **GBPCHF**, resulted in significant losses. Careful pair selection and analysis are crucial for consistent performance.

4. **Consistency is Important**: While the overall result was positive, there were both winning and losing trades. This highlights the importance of sticking to a strategy and not being discouraged by individual losses.

## Conclusion:

Testing on a **real cTrader account** provided valuable insights into how small accounts can perform in live trading conditions. Over a 2-3 day period, the $300 account generated a 5.12% return, while smaller accounts ($100 and $200) showed even higher percentage returns. The most profitable pair was **NZDJPY**, while **GBPJPY** was the least profitable.

This real-world test demonstrates that with proper risk management and strategy, even small accounts can achieve meaningful returns. However, it’s important to remain disciplined and avoid overtrading, especially when dealing with smaller account sizes.
